    "#### 🔄 The Loop Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a loop as an **assembly line** in a factory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **conveyor belt** keeps moving items\n",
    "- Each item goes through the **same process**\n",
    "- The belt **stops** when all items are processed (or a stop button is pressed)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Under the Hood\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python encounters a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It evaluates the **condition** (Is there more work to do?)\n",
    "2. If `True`, it executes the **loop body** (the indented code)\n",
    "3. It **repeats** step 1\n",
    "4. If `False`, it **exits** the loop and continues with code after the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Why Loops Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Test 1\")\n",
    "print(\"Test 2\")\n",
    "print(\"Test 3\")\n",
    "# ... 997 more lines ...\n",
    "print(\"Test 1000\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
